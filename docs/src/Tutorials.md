# Tutorials

Running the tutorials is the fastest way to learn how to use **Eegle** and the way it integrates many packages for EEG analysis and classification.

Tutorials are organized by themes; start with those more closely ressambling to your research need at hand.

### Things to know
- We always fully-qualified the name of functions. This way you can easily the package where they can be found. In your code, you don't need to do that.
- For producing figures in these tutorials we use CairoMakie or GLMakie. Install then first by executing in the REPL

```julia
]add CairoMakie, GLMakie
```

- For plotting EEG traces and topographic maps we use dedicated applications running only under Windows. The output is always given so that you can follow the tutorials also if you work with another OS.
