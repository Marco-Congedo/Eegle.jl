# Eegle

**Eegle** is organized as a collection of independent modules. They are all re-exported, along with fundamental external packages,
forming an integrated library. Thus, if you state

```julia
using Eegle
```

you have access of all functions exported by all **Eegle** modules and by all re-exported external packages.

Like external packages, **Eegle** modules can be used individually. 
For example, if you only need some functions for preprocessing
and signal processing, you can state

```julia
    using Eegle.preprocessing, DSP
```

In this case, however, you must install DSP.jl as well.

## Tips & Tricks

### general T&T

Julia is a just-in-time compiled, column-major, 1-based indexing language.
In practice for using this package this means that:
- The first time you execute a function, it will be compiled. From the second on, it will go fast
- EEG data are organized in ``N√óT`` matrices, where ``N`` and ``T`` denotes the number of samples and channels, respectively
- `for` loops starts at 1. For indexing, whenever possible, in Julia you should use [eachindex](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/arrays/#Base.eachindex).

### ‚Ñç and the ‚ÑçVector type

Covariance matrices and vectors thereof play an important role in EEG data analysis and classification.
**Eegle** follows the framework of package **PosDefManifold.jl**, which requires flagging these matrices as `Hermitian`.
Reading this documentation on [typecasting matrices](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/MainModule/#typecasting-matrices-1)
can turn useful.

## How to Contribute

### Code conventions

- When using a method of the **Eegle** package, qualify the module it is taken from, for example: 
    - `Eegle.FileSystem.getFilesInDir(dbDir; ext=(".npz", ), isin)`
- Communicate the module and function when printing a messages within a function, for example: 
    - `@warn "Eegle.Database, function loadNYdb: the $filemane files has not been found:\n"`
- The name of internal functions (not-exported) begins by an underscore, for example: 
    - `function _weightsDB(...)`
- The name of functions modifying one or more arguments ends with an exclamation mark, for example:
    - `function myFunc!(...)`
- Whenever appropriate, methods should give feedback to the user. Use meaningful symbols such as:
    - `‚úì`, `‚úó`, `‚äò`, `‚ö†Ô∏è` ‚Äî see [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/) for a list of supported unicode symbols
- For name of functions composed by several words, capitalize the words starting from the second, for example:
    - `function myFunc(...)`
- Acronyms in name of functions may or may not be fully capitalized, for example: 
    - `function weightsDB(...)`
- For name of functions composed by several words, capitalize the words starting from the second, for example:
    - `function myFunc(...)`, `function loadNYdb(...)`
- If you add a method in a module, update the commented "CONTENT" section in the module's header
- If you add a new public function in a module, make sure: 
    - you add the documentation right on top of the function (no blank lines)
    - you add the function in the `export` section
    - you add the function in the docstring of the module's .md file in the docs/src directory.
- Leave an empty space around the `=` sign
- Follows Julia general conventions:
    - functions starts by a lower-case letter, while structures and modules by a capital letter 
    - in general, constants are fully capitalized
    - functions modifying one or more of the arguments start by `!`
    - internal functions start by `_`.

### Documentation

- For simple functions and methods, the documentation should be short and illustrated by examples
- For complex functions and methods accepting many arguments, the documentation should comprise four sections: 
    - **Arguments** (if applicable) 
    - **Optional Keyword Arguments** (if applicable)
    - **Return**
    - **Examples**. 
- Whenever relevant, the documentation of functions should include:
    - a **See** list providing the link to related functions in **Eegle**
    - a **See Also** list providing the link to somehow related functions or to function not in **Eegle**
    - a **Tutorials** section linking to relevant tutorials.
- Always start the **Example** section with line:
```julia 
using Eegle 
```
- Arguments and optional keyword arguments (kargs) are given as a list 
    and their possible values, whenever relevant, as a sub-list 
- Only the last item of a list or sub-list should ened with a dot
- Fully qualify links to functions of other modules, for example: [`Eegle.Preprocessing.removeSamples`](@ref)
- Do not fully qualify functions whose name is imported from an existing external package, for example: [`mean`](@ref)
- End a list without punctuation, except for the last item of the list, like in this list.
- For Markdown text:
    - headings of level 1 and 2 capitalzes all words
    - headings of level 3 capitalize only the first word
    - headings of level 4 do not capitalize any words. 

To get started, use the existing documentation as a template.

### Notation & Nomenclature

The following notation is followed throughout the code:

- **Quantities** are denoted by upper case letters and their index by lower-case letters, e.g., ``n‚àà[1..N]``
- **vectors** are denoted using lower-case letters, e.g., `y`,
- **matrices** using upper case letters, e.g., `X`
- **sets (vectors) of matrices** using bold upper-case letters, e.g., `ùêó` (escape sequence \bfX).

In the code examples, bold upper-case letters may replaced by
upper case letters in order to facilitate testing the code in the REPL.

The following nomenclature is used consistently:

- `X`: an **EEG data matrix** (`ùêó`: a vector of **EEG data matrices**)
- `C`, `P`, `Q`: **positive-definite matrices** (idem)
- `D`: a **diagonal matrix** (idem)
- `U`: an **orthogonal matrix** (idem)
- `Œª`: an **eigenvalue** (idem)
- `o`: an **EEG data structure** (idem)
- `y`: a vector of **class labels**
- `z`: **number of classes** for ERP or BCI data
- `k`: **number of matrices** in a set

## Acronyms

- AI: affine-invariant (also known as Fisher-Rao metric)
- BCI: brain-computer interface
- CAR: common average reference
- cv: cross-validation
- EEG: electroencephalography
- ENLR: elastic-net gogistic regression
- ERP: event-related potential
- kwarg: (optional) keyword argument
- MDM: minimum distance to mean
- MI: motor Imagery (a BCI paradigm)
- P300: the P300 BCI paradigm
- SVM: support-vector machine
