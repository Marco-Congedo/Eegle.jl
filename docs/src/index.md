# Eegle Documentation
The EEG General Library (**Eegle**) is a general-purpose package for
preprocessing and processing human Electroencephalography (EEG) data.

It is the foundational building block that enables the integration of diverse
state-of-the-art packages, leveraging the powerful [Julia](https://julialang.org/) scientific eco-system.

It also provides some modules for advanced EEG analysis.

**Eegle** promotes standardization, conventions and a learning approach based on simple examples and advanced tutorials.
